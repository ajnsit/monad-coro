Synopsis:            Coroutine monad transformer for suspending and resuming monadic computations
Category:            Concurrency, Control, Monads
Tested-with:         GHC
Description:         This package defines a monad transformer, applicable to any monad, that allows the
                     monadic computation to suspend and to be later resumed. The transformer is parameterized
                     by an arbitrary functor, used to store the suspended computation's resumption.
